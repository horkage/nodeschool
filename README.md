Code sample solutions to nodeschool.io exercises

Each file contains my solution and the official solution for comparison to a given exercise.  My solution is on top, while the official solution is on the bottom, commented out.  Some of the examples may still have my own implementation tests prior to the actual export for validating my solutions.

So far, as time has allowed, I have completed learnyounode, functional javascript and promises.
